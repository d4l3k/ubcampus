# UBCampus

A campus map system for UBC.

It's a system to replace/supplement the existing [http://maps.ubc.ca](maps.ubc.ca) system. The current WayFinding system is getting kind of dated, and it seems that a modern interactive replacement is needed.

## Demo

Currently the only maps are for the Computer Science building.
